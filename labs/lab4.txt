1. Create a module that contains a function named "sort_uuids". This function reads the file sample.txt ( download ), 
	and sorts the lines base on the string that is between the first and second dash ("-"). 
	Ex: 00e43761-e18a-40c6-b252-3407aa1d8e45 => is sorted by "e18a".  
	There might be situations where the code might raise Exception. Catch them all ! 
	Create a new file, named "results.txt". 
	Write in this file the sorted uuids. 

	A universally unique identifier (UUID) is a 128-bit number used to identify information in computer systems. 
	In its canonical textual representation, the sixteen octets of a UUID are represented as 32 hexadecimal (base 16) digits, 
	displayed in five groups separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12 for a total of 36 characters 
	(32 alphanumeric characters and four hyphens). (wiki)


2. Using the same file from Problem 1 (sample.txt), modify the line that does not respect the uuid format (if there is any). 
	This modification means to replace the bad line with this message "|INVALID_UUID|". 
	You may use the file cursor to make the changes (seek or tell)


3. Write a script that reads a file, line by line, and for every triple (a, b, c - separated by spaces) applies operator c for 
	the operands a and b. The valid operations are : +, *, -,  \, ** .

	Input Example:

			3 5 ** => 3 ** 5 =  243
			7 2 + => 7 + 2   = 9
